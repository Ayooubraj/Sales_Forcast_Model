# Restaurant Sales Forecasting Project

This project involves building a machine learning-based predictive model to forecast monthly restaurant sales. The model uses historical sales data to generate predictions and provides an interactive dashboard for visualization.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques for accurate restaurant sales forecasting. The model helps businesses make informed decisions about inventory, staffing, and marketing.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
- Anaconda Navigator

## Dataset
The dataset contains monthly restaurant sales records, including:
- Date (monthly sales period)
- Sales (total sales for each month)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and handling missing data.
3. **Model Development:** Training models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2 score.
5. **Visualization:** Plotting sales trends and predictions.

## Results
The Linear Regression model provided reasonable predictions, with performance metrics indicating good model fit. The visualization demonstrates monthly sales trends and predicted values effectively.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`

## Future Work
- Incorporating external factors like holidays or promotions.
- Experimenting with advanced forecasting models.
- Enhancing the dashboard for better user interaction.
